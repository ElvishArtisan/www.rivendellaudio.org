                  Cart Database Schema for Rivendell
                             Version 0.1

The CARTS table holds data concerning all of the available audio
selections in a Rivendell system that are capable of being
individually scheduled.  Following is the layout of a record
in the CARTS table:

DESCRIPTION          TYPE    LENGTH   REMARKS
---------------------------------------------------------------
Cart Number          char       6     Range 000000 - 999999

Album Name           char     256
Release Year         date       8     
ISRC Code            char      12     International Standard Recording Code

Start Date/Time      datetime  20     
End Date/Time        datetime  20     



The CUTS table holds data concerning each individual audio cut on the
system, as opposed to CARTS, where individual entries may reference
more than one cut (as in the case of rotators).  Following is the
layout of a record in the CUTS table:

DESCRIPTION          TYPE    LENGTH   REMARKS
---------------------------------------------------------------
Cut ID               char      12   * Base name of WAV file
Cart Number          char       6     Parent Cart Entry
Out Cue		     char      64
Length               int        4     Overall length in 1/100 seconds.
Origin Date/Time     datetime  20     Date/Time when recorded
Origin Station ID    char      64     Station ID where recorded
Format Tag           int        4     0 = PCM16, 2 = Layer-2, 3 = Layer-3 
Sample Rate          int        4     In samples/sec
Channels             int        4     1 = mono, 2 = stereo
Start Cuepoint       int        4     Offset to Start point in 1/100 seconds
FadeUp Cuepoint      int        4     Offset to FadeUp point in 1/100 seconds
FadeDown Cuepoint    int        4     Offset to FadeDown point in 1/100 seconds
End Cuepoint         int        4     Offset to End point in 1/100 seconds
PRI Cuepoint         int        4     Offset to PRI point in 1/100 seconds
SEC Cuepoint         int        4     Offset to SEC point in 1/100 seconds
TER Cuepoint         int        4     Offset to TER point in 1/100 seconds


* Names of WAV files are calculated as follows:

    CCCCCC_NNN.wav

  where:
    CCCCCC = The cart number (000000 - 999999)
       NNN = The rotator offset (000 - 999)

  Thus, we can accomodate up to 1000 cuts in a single rotator.  The
  base name is that part of the name prior to '.wav'.
